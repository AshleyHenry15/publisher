# quarto-multidoc-proj-none

A basic Quarto project with multiple documents.

- This project was generated using the IDE's Quarto project template, then manually edited.
- The manifest was generated by using the IDE's push-button publishing, then downloading the source bundle. It was edited to remove `.Rprofile` and `packrat.lock`.

This project has [multiple render targets](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html#render-targets) specified in `_quarto.yml`. This means that when you run `quarto render` in its directory, both documents get rendered. (This is the default behavior though.)

When deploying to RStudio Connect, multi-document projects — that are not websites or books — are not natively supported, because each document generates a content item. Instead, you'll just publish a single document from the project. The `manifest.json` in this repo specifies that only `document1.qmd` will be published.

By default (at time of writing, 2022-02-09), `_quarto.yml` is not included in deployments unless it is listed under `resource_files` in a document's front matter. The IDE will automatically add it if you add it to a document when publishing with push-button publishing.
