```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a minimal document which will set a pin on the Connect instance to which it is deployed.

It will fail to build unless the environment variables `CONNECT_SERVER` and `CONNECT_API_KEY` are available.

```{r register_board}
library(pins)
library(rsconnect)
board_register_rsconnect()
```

```{r create_data}
data(mtcars)
to_pin <- mtcars[c("mpg", "wt")]
```

```{r pin_data}
pin(to_pin, name = "mt_mpg_wt", board = "rsconnect")
```

```{r get_data}
got <- pin_get("mt_mpg_wt", board = "rsconnect")
got
plot(got$wt, got$wt)
```
