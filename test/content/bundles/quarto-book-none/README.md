# quarto-book-none

- This file was created using RStudio's default book project.
- `_quarto.yml` was edited to remove the PDF output specification, as this causes deployment failures on Connect.
- The manifest was generated by using the IDE's push-button publishing, then downloading the source bundle. It was edited to remove `.Rprofile` and `packrat.lock`.
