# quarto-proj-none-ojs

A Quarto document with Observable JS (OJS) cells that load a CSV file from the bundle.

## Creation and Contents

- This bundle was created by duplicating and editing `quarto-proj-r-shiny` â€” removing all the R-specific stuff.
- It uses a Palmer Penguins example from the [Quarto website](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/blob/main/docs/interactive/ojs/examples/penguins.qmd).
- The manifest was created by deploying via the IDE and downloading the bundle.
