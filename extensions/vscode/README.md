## Features

### Code-first deployment

Configure your content and then deploy to Posit Connect with a click.

[Configuration files](https://github.com/posit-dev/publisher/blob/main/docs/configuration.md)
allow setting up how you want your content to look and run on Connect - from
choosing a title and description to
[Runtime process settings](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/content-settings/#content-runtime).

Keep your content stable with language and tool versions set in your
configurations â€” all automatically detected based on your local environment.

Everything is saved in the `.posit/` directory for easy re-deployment and
collaboration.

### Seamless collaboration

Allow Collaborators to easily pick up where you left off by committing the
`.posit/` directory to your version control system. Your team can deploy using
the same deployments and configurations.

### Track all deployments for a project

Easily track all deployments for a project with Posit Publisher.

For example, create separate deployments for staging and production.

### Deployment logs

Logs are organized to easily identify what went wrong.
